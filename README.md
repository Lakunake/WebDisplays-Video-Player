* 📡 Can be used over LAN, Hamachi, or hosted publicly (Render etc.)
* ⚙️ Lightweight Node.js + Express server
* 🖱️ Custom video control zones (click-based)

## 🕹️ Controls

Click-based controls have been implemented for easy, mouse-only interaction:

| Zone                                   | Action                   | Sync Behavior |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| **Left Edge (≤ 87px)**                 | ⏪ Rewind 5 seconds       | ✅ Synced      |
| **Right Edge (≥ screen width − 87px)** | ⏩ Skip forward 5 seconds | ✅ Synced      |
| **Center (±75px from center)**         | ⎯️ Toggle Play / Pause   | ✅ Synced      |
| **Between Left Edge and Center**       | 🔈 Decrease volume (5%)  | ❌ Local only  |
| **Between Center and Right Edge**      | 🔊 Increase volume (5%)  | ❌ Local only  |

> ⚠️ All users will see the same video at the same time except for **volume**, which is controlled individually per client.

## 🌐 Hosting Tutorials

> ⚠️ All commands are run from Command Prompt (CMD).
> Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed before proceeding.
> Place `videos/`, `server.js`, and `index.html` in the same folder, e.g. `C:\YourFolder\`.

### 🔌 Option 1: LAN or Public IP (Direct Hosting)

1. Run `start.bat` in your folder
2. Make sure your selected port is open in your firewall/router.
3. Access the video from another device at the links given
   
### 🌍 Option 2: Hamachi (Virtual LAN)

1. Download and install [LogMeIn Hamachi](https://vpn.net).
2. Create a network, have others join it.
3. Share your **Hamachi IP address** (shown in Hamachi).
4. Run `start.bat`, then visit the `Your Network` link

### 🚂 Option 3: Hosting on Render or any other Cloud Hosting Service (Not Recommended)

1. Go to [Render](https://render.com).
2. Create a new project → Deploy from GitHub.
3. Connect your repository:
   [https://github.com/Lakunake/WebDisplays-Video-Player](https://github.com/Lakunake/WebDisplays-Video-Player)

## 📁 File Structure

```
/videos/filmeva.mp4     # Your synced video file
server.js               # Node.js backend for socket and file serving
index.html              # The frontend video player
package.json            # This tells Node.js which dependencies to install and how to run the server
start.bat               # The start file, gives you the link of the server
config.txt              # Optional config file to customize server port, install behavior, and launch settings
